									<h3>1. Recomendation from Joshua B., QA Manager 2023</h3>
								</header>
								<blockquote>
									When I hired Mia, I knew that she had an outstanding background and 
									that she would be an excellent fit on the team, even if she didn't see it 
									yet. What I did not know was that the project I would be putting her on 
									would be an incredibly frustrating and protracted adventure of shifting scopes, 
									third-party integrations that absolutely did not work how they were supposed 
									to, and questionable technical decisions. Nevertheless, Mia did her job 
									extremely patiently and extremely well, going far beyond anyone's reasonable 
									expectations and dramatically improving what had been very shaky confidence in 
									the project's ability to complete, much less complete as expected or anywhere near 
									on time. While she had come to me as a seasoned professional, she came out on the 
									other side of that project as a well recognized authority on quality in general 
									and the many, many intricacies that can arise in the complex interactions of many, 
									many backend services. While I hope that Mia never again has to work on a project 
									like that one, I have an unshakable faith in her ability to truly own quality for 
									projects and products of any size, advocating cogently for the teams she supports 
									to make sensible, reasonable, humane decisions that balance business needs with the 
									experience of the customer, and providing thorough, careful automated testing regimes 
									to ensure that customer experience. I would not hesitate to invite Mia to work with me again.

									<h3>Recomendation from Nicole R., Chief Data Officer 2021</h3>
								</header>
								<blockquote>
									Mia's technical acumen is unparalleled, and her solution strategies and instincts are spot on. 
									In addition, she is tuned in to what technical work will actually produce business value, and 
									what won't. If Mia's telling you you're heading in a less than optimal direction and there's a 
									better way, there is - you get to make the decision about whether you want to pivot now (less pain) 
									or pivot later (more pain). Although Mia would be ideal for organizations that are just setting 
									up a Software Test Automation strategy, she's a technical Swiss army knife, and if the task requires 
									programming and figuring out a tough technical solution or complex enterprise system - give her 
									the time and space to get into it, and if a solution exists... you can trust her to find it. If 
									it doesn't, she'll give you alternatives.

									<h3>Recommendation from Lily M., Senior Quality Engineer II 2021</h3>
								</header>
								<blockquote>
									I've had the honor of working with Mia on several very high profile projects over the last few years. 
									I've yet to encounter a more capable and diligent engineer in my career. She has a unique flair for 
									breaking down complicated processes into easily managed parts, and is able to deftly delegate tasks to 
									the most appropriate resources available. Mia has always made herself available whenever her input or 
									advice is requested. She is an amazing asset to whatever team or project she is a part of.

									<h3>Recommendation from Adiran D., VP of Product Management 2019</h3>
								</header>
								<blockquote>
									It is rare in the dependable innovation space that a product manager gets to work with an engineering 
									lead that is as dedicated to understanding very complex business requirements of an industry and can 
									innovate and motivate their team. Mia was an absolute joy to work with on a number of very ambitious 
									and by the consequence of the number of third parties involved, and ever changing scope, ambiguous 
									projects. With Mia's leadership and skill teams were more productive and leadership clearly understood 
									deadlines, blockers, and the strategic vision driving tactical decisions. Mia was very proactive and 
									exactly what one looks for in a partner. If I had the opportunity I would work with Mia again in a heart beat.

									<h3>Recommendation from Mario S., Frond-End Developer at a client company 2016</h3>
								</header>
								<blockquote>
									I've had the pleasure of working with Mia across a couple different projects and she's extremely efficient, 
									detail oriented and goes above and beyond. She's always able to find a number of valid bugs/defects that my 
									team misses during development, sometimes even the ones outside the testing plan and or use cases. The key 
									point is, Mia allows us to deliver better products to our clients.

									<h3>Recommendation from John M., Engagement Manager 2016</h3>
								</header>
								<blockquote>
									Mia has a proven track record as a tester, both in quantity and quality of the defects she has found over 
									10+ projects in the past year. She is proactive in communications, and is able to apply changing priorities 
									and requirements to her testing process. A client favorite, I know the bugs will be found, the documentation 
									clear, and general feedback will be on point when I have Mia on the team.
